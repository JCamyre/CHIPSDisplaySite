He would study through the night and leave just as the sun began to bathe campus in a warm glow to repeat the cycle all over again.\n“My best memory was actually walking through campus at 6 a.m., going into the parking lot. It’s such a beautiful campus, [and at that hour] it’s serene and quiet,” said Shek, the newly elected president of the UCLA Samueli Engineering Alumni Association (EAA)’s governing board. He succeeded Marianne So B.S. ’07, M.B.A. ’17, who served as president from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2022.\nWhile keeping a schedule with little to no sleep sounds grueling to most, Shek said he hardly noticed it while doing research on a communication optimization framework. \n“I didn’t feel it. It was the fun of the work itself. It’s the excitement of trying to make something new,” Shek said. \nAfter five years of late nights and early commutes, the double Bruin earned his Ph.D. in 1997 and continued to work at HRL as a researcher and project manager. A few years later, he started his own tech company, Vizional Technologies, developing radio-frequency identification software applications designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes by managing and tracing the physical movements of assets and inventory.\nShek later sold the enterprise to Maersk Logistics. But this was just the first in a string of his entrepreneurial ventures. Before becoming a business consultant, Shek founded multiple other tech companies, helping businesses manage their supply chains and products.\nThis was not the professional journey Shek had envisioned when he started his Ph.D. program.\n“If you asked my 15-year-old self, no, I wouldn’t imagine myself being an entrepreneur,” he said. “I could see myself being a professor, which is why I started my Ph.D. in the first place.”\nBut Shek found that the path he ended up on not only was made possible by his Ph.D. program, where he made industry connections that led him to found companies, but it also has allowed him to be a lifelong learner.\nThroughout his time as an entrepreneur and even after he transitioned into his current business consulting role, Shek has found time to mentor undergraduate and graduate computer science students at UCLA, an experience he finds rewarding.\n\n“The kinds of tools they use, the way they approach problems is very different, so I do get a lot out of my interactions with students that I mentor from just thinking about how they think about things,” Eddie Shek said.\n\nIt was his mentorship experience that led Shek to the UCLA Samueli Engineering Alumni Association. At a mentoring meeting, fellow alumnus Bill Goodin, a long-serving governing board member and frequent volunteer, invited him to attend an Engineering Alumni Association board meeting to learn more about the organization.\nAfter this initial introduction, Shek quickly started finding more ways to be involved with UCLA Samueli, attending board meetings, reviewing student-led projects and offering help wherever he could.\nLast year, Shek served on the association’s board as the awards committee chair, helping gather alumni nominations and promote the awards.\nIn his new role as the president of the EAA board, Shek said he’d like to accomplish a few goals in the two-year term. He plans to coordinate with the school’s different departments to help them expand their own alumni networks. He will also engage alumni outside of the Los Angeles area, fundraise for the school and support the school’s efforts in equity, diversity and inclusion.\n“I’ve really enjoyed my time on the board and am definitely looking forward to continuing to play a role,” Shek said.\nAs the first in his family to finish college, Shek views being actively involved in the alumni community as an extension of the college experience. He has benefited a great deal from his mentors and advisors from his time at UCLA, so Shek hopes to return the favor.\n“I finished my [undergraduate degree at Stony Brook University] in three years, so I spent way more time at UCLA; it’s a way bigger part of my educational journey and I definitely have to attribute whatever success in my career — in life — to my education,” Shek said. “It’s all about giving back.”\nLaunched in 1998, the UCLA Samueli Engineering Alumni Association has built its success on the generous support of the school’s many talented alumni who volunteer their time and efforts to help foster a welcoming and inclusive UCLA Samueli community for its more than 40,000 alumni.

The scholarship was created to recognize outstanding students from across all of UCLA Samueli’s engineering disciplines. \nWhen Luzuriaga was in first grade, she failed a test for the first time. But it wasn’t a test for which she could study. It was a hearing test.\nLuzuriaga was taken by surprise when she was diagnosed with mild-moderate hearing loss and thought initially that it must have been a mistake. After all, she was able to hear people talk just fine, except when they’d whisper. She was subsequently fitted for hearing aids, which helped her hear things clearly for the first time, but it also made her feel insecure and self-conscious in the beginning. \n“It was something that I didn’t want people to know about; I would always keep my hair down and never put it up in a ponytail,” she said. “But I told my friends about it, and they were like, ‘Oh, this is so cool! Can I see it?’ That’s when I realized it’s not something to be ashamed of, but it’s actually a really cool part of my identity.”\nHaving experienced how technology can be leveraged to improve her day-to-day life, Luzuriaga created her first app during a hackathon while she was in high school. Inspired by her peers who had much more severe hearing loss, Luzuriaga developed an app called “sPeach” so that her friends and others could practice pronouncing words correctly without relying on the assistance of a speech therapist. The app employs speech recognition technology to enable direct user feedback via smartphones so it helps build independence and confidence.\n\n“That was the first app I built that wasn’t for entertainment purposes. I built games before that, but this was an actual app that people could use, and they could actually benefit from,” Luzuriaga said.\n\n“That was the first app I built that wasn’t for entertainment purposes. I built games before that, but this was an actual app that people could use, and they could actually benefit from,” Luzuriaga said. “So that’s when I realized whatever I decided to work on in the future, I want to make sure that it really helps people in some way.”\nLuzuriaga’s passion for creating new tech didn’t stop there. When it came time for college, the East Coast native wanted a change in scenery, and a place buzzing with promising up-and-coming tech discoveries. What better place than Southern California and UCLA! \n“It’s just a fantastic school. It has many active student organizations doing very impactful work, which I knew I wanted to be a part of,” she said. She chose to major in computer science not because of a desire to work for well-established big tech companies but because of the skillsets she can learn and translate into new tech to help make people’s lives easier.\nGrowing up in a close-knit family, Luzuriaga said the transition to the West Coast culture and surroundings wasn’t easy at first. And just as she started to feel more at home after her freshman year, the pandemic hit. As remote learning took effect at UCLA, Luzuriaga found herself without an internship or job. But she and her friends were itching to work on something new. So, they enrolled in Bruin Labs, a 10-week accelerator program put on by Bruin Entrepreneurs that teaches participants how to create their own start-ups.\nLuzuriaga and her friends created Hussle, a freelance marketplace mobile app that supports college students in starting and managing their own small businesses of selling products or offering services to others on campus. The app was launched in April and already has more than 200 users.\n\n“Stay true to yourself; make sure you really think about what you want to do in life and target companies that alignwith the type of work you want to be doing,” Luzuriaga said.\n\n“We noticed that there are people on campus cutting hair, there are people on campus doing manicures, but the only way you can find them is through word of mouth or Instagram,” Luzuriaga said. “So we wanted to make a platform all UCLA students are on and that will allow people to grow their small businesses by being able to reach their target audience.”\nWith the help of the scholarship, Luzuriaga said she is grateful to have some extra time to devote to extracurricular activities. She is a part of Nova — Tech for Good, a student organization that aims to build technical solutions for nonprofits within the LA area and beyond. Luzuriaga serves as a project lead for building a mobile app called “iiDecide,” which is an iOS chatting app that connects victims of sexual assault so that they can talk about their experiences in a safe and comfortable space. “The mission and how impactful it will be for that community is definitely something that really resonates with me, and it also aligns with my values of why I decided to go into computer science in the first place,” she said.\nLuzuriaga also belongs to Sigma Eta Pi, an entrepreneurship fraternity on campus, through which she gets to meet like-minded individuals who are into entrepreneurship and the startup and venture capital space. She served on the Society of Women Engineers’ advocacy committee that hosts events to encourage women engineers to advocate for themselves. Having volunteered to teach coding classes in high school, she has hosted workshops for exploretech.la, an annual event where high school students come to UCLA to learn how to code and explore tech. \nWhen she first came to UCLA, Luzuriaga said she felt a lot of pressure to go into big tech, which is what she saw many of her peers doing. But following her passions for entrepreneurship taught her that there are many different ways to find success as a software engineer and that it’s OK to not follow traditional paths.\nThrough it all, Luzuriaga credits everything she has accomplished so far to the strong work ethic she learned from her parents and encourages other students to not be afraid of putting in extra effort to achieve their goals.\n“Stay true to yourself; make sure you really think about what you want to do in life and target companies that align with the type of work you want to be doing,” she said. “And then from there, you can create your own path that you’re looking forward to, and you’re building the life that you want to have.” \nHer second piece of advice? “Work hard and never underestimate yourself,” she said. “I’m not naturally intelligent and struggled a lot with my academics, especially computer science. But when you believe in yourself, you’ll be surprised with what you are capable of and can accomplish.”\nSara Hubbard contributed to this story.","summary":"Natalia Luzuriaga knows firsthand the power of technology to make people’s lives better having overcome her own experiences with partial hearing loss"},{"img":"https://samueli.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/samueli/Anthony-Chen-800x450-1.jpg","date":"Jul 12, 2022","summary":"Xiang “Anthony” Chen, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, has received a Google Research Scholar Program Award for his research in human-computer interaction","title":"UCLA Electrical and Computer Engineer Receives Google Research Scholar Program Award","full_text":"Xiang “Anthony” Chen, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, has received a Google Research Scholar Program Award for his research in human-computer interaction.\nThe award, which supports world-class research conducted by early-career professors, includes a prize of up to $60,000 to support Chen’s research on extracting human knowledge to augment  artificial intelligence training. \nA leader of UCLA’s Human Computer Interaction Research team, Chen focuses on building interactive intelligent systems so that humans can more easily share information.

The UCLA project’s principal investigator is materials science and engineering professor Bruce Dunn, who holds UCLA’s Nippon Sheet Glass Company Chair. He is also UCLA Samueli’s associate dean for research and physical resources. Materials science and engineering professor Morris Wang, who joined UCLA from LLNL in 2020, is the co-principal investigator.\nThe team’s eventual goal is to improve lithium-ion batteries by increasing the available power, speeding up charging time, and making them cheaper to manufacture while wasting less material in the process. 3D printing allows for the creation of a more intricate interior battery structure that can store more power — a development critical to the new manufacturing process.\nLithium-ion batteries, with their excellent energy-to-weight ratios, are already ubiquitous in phones, laptops, electric vehicles and a range of other consumer products. However, there are limits to the power they can provide and how fast they can be charged. More powerful lithium ion batteries could lead to the development and adoption of more clean electric vehicles, as well as new energy storage technologies for the electric grid.\nThe new project builds on a previous collaboration between UCLA and LLNL that led to the development of several cathode ink compositions and demonstrated excellent performance in 3D-printed cathodes, which are the part of the battery that contains lithium ion.

While many materials have been considered contenders for making artificial muscles, dielectric elastomers (DE) — lightweight materials with high elastic energy density — have been of special interest because of their optimal flexibility and toughness. \nDielectric elastomers are electroactive polymers, which are natural or synthetic substances composed of large molecules that can change in size or shape when stimulated by an electric field. They can be used as actuators, enabling machines to operate by transforming electric energy into mechanical work.\nMost dielectric elastomers are made of either acrylic or silicone, but both materials have drawbacks. While traditional acrylic DEs can achieve high actuation strain, they require pre-stretching and lack flexibility. Silicones are easier to make, but they cannot withstand high strain. \nUtilizing commercially available chemicals and employing an ultraviolet (UV) light curing process, the UCLA-led research team created an improved acrylic-based material that is more pliable, tunable and simpler to scale without losing its strength and endurance. While the acrylic acid enables more hydrogen bonds to form, thereby making the material more movable, the researchers also adjusted the crosslinking between polymer chains, enabling the elastomers to be softer and more flexible. The resulting thin, processable, high-performance dielectric elastomer film, or PHDE, is then sandwiched between two electrodes to convert electrical energy into motion as an actuator. \nEach PHDE film is as thin and light as a piece of human hair, about 35 micrometers in thickness, and when multiple layers are stacked together, they become a miniature electric motor that can act like muscle tissue and produce enough energy to power motion for small robots or sensors. The researchers have made stacks of PHDE films varying from four to 50 layers.\n\n“This flexible, versatile and efficient actuator could open the gates for artificial muscles in new generations of robots, or in sensors and wearable tech that can more accurately mimic or even improve humanlike motion and capabilities,” Qibing Pei said.\n\nArtificial muscles fitted with PHDE actuators can generate more megapascals of force than biological muscles and they also demonstrate three to 10 times more flexibility than natural muscles.\nMultilayered soft films are usually manufactured via a “wet” process that involves depositing and curing liquid resin. But that process can result in uneven layers, which make for a poor- performing actuator. For this reason, up to now, many actuators have only been successful with single-layer DE films. \nThe UCLA research involves a “dry” process by which the films are layered using a blade and then UV-cured to harden, making the layers uniform. This increases the actuator’s energy output so that the device can support more complex movements.\nThe simplified process, along with the flexible and durable nature of the PHDE, allows for the manufacture of new soft actuators capable of bending to jump, like spider legs, or winding up and spinning. The researchers also demonstrated the PHDE actuator’s ability to toss a pea-sized ball 20 times heavier than the PHDE films. The actuator can also expand and contract like a diaphragm when a voltage is switched on and off, giving a glimpse of how artificial muscles could be used in the future. \n\nhttps://samueli.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/samueli/Compiled-PHDE-SI-Videos.mp4\nCourtesy of Qibing PeiUCLA researchers demonstrate the capabilities of the PHDE actuators they developed that can expand, contract and toss a pea-sized ball.\n\nThe advance could lead to soft robots with improved mobility and endurance, and new wearable and haptic technologies with a sense of touch. The manufacturing process could also be applied to other soft thin-film materials for applications including microfluidic technologies, tissue engineering or microfabrication.\nOther authors of the study from the UCLA Materials Science and Engineering Department are Ye Shi, Erin Askounis, Roshan Plamthottam, Zihang Peng, Kareem Youssef and Junhong Pu —all current or former members of Pei’s Soft Materials Research Lab at UCLA.
