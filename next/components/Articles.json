The advancement could lead to life-saving applications for search-and-rescue robots and enhance current technology used in autonomous vehicles or planetary exploration. \nMobile robots rely on simultaneous localization and mapping in order to operate effectively and efficiently. In recent years, light-detection and ranging technology, or lidar, has allowed robots to visualize their operating environment (mapping) and understand how to navigate their dynamic surroundings (location) at the same time. However, there remained fundamental limitations on lidar-powered robots’ mapping accuracy and reaction time as they struggle with massive data processing and computational complexity.\nLed by project investigator and assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering Brett Lopez at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, the team developed a new algorithm to address the challenges. Built upon the current lidar sensing technology, direct lidar-inertial odometry and mapping, or DLIOM, is the focus of a UCLA study presented at the 2023 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International Conference on Robotics and Automation. \n“The algorithm we developed produces precise geometric maps of nearly any environment in real time using a compact sensor and computing suite,” said study first author Kenny Chen, a recent UCLA electrical and computer engineering doctoral graduate. “It has several key advantages over other current solutions including faster computational speed, better map accuracy and improved operational reliability.”\nRyan Nemiroff, an electrical and computer engineering graduate student, is the third team member. Using a custom-built quadcopter drone, the researchers flew their DLIOM-powered unmanned aerial robot around UCLA’s Royce Hall and surrounding buildings in Dickson Plaza, the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden, the Court of Sciences and the Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden. The test flights found the new algorithm-embedded drone performed 20% faster and 12% more accurately than those armed with current state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImage courtesy of the Verifiable and Control-Theoretic Robotics Laboratory at UCLAA custom-built quadcopter drone powered by new algorithms developed by UCLA researchers\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAccording to the researchers, DLIOM boasts several fundamental innovations designed to enhance a robot’s capabilities such as remembering previously visited locations, utilizing only relevant environmental information, adapting to changing surroundings, correcting blurry incoming imaging from its sensors and processing novel data. DLIOM also expedites the speed with which the autonomous robot operates by combining the data collection and process into a single step.\nThe new computational method requires little hands-on tuning for different environments, such as a thick forest or a sprawling suburb, thereby allowing the robot to explore various topographies on a single trip without human intervention. In essence, the algorithm enables the robot to process information so quickly that they can configure their journey as they go. \n“When we send next-generation robots to explore other worlds, they will need to handle a range of environments and conditions, as well as establishing their own maps of their local surroundings,” said Lopez, who directs the Verifiable and Control-Theoretic Robotics Laboratory at UCLA. “Our new algorithm shows a great path forward to solving latency problems associated with mapping and localization challenges. More immediately, this could help enhance next-generation robots for safer self-driving vehicles, and for search-and-rescue and infrastructure-inspection efforts.”\nIn designing its algorithm, the team incorporated an inertial measurement unit (IMU) device that measures the gravity and angular rate of an object to which it is attached. By combining lidar      scans with IMU, the researchers developed robots that show improved localization accuracy and mapping clarity. \nThe current version of DLIOM is an update of a 2022 iteration published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters and available through IEEE’s research database Xplore. It was developed by Chen, Lopez and their colleagues at UCLA and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory for Team CoSTAR. The NASA team was one of the finalists in a subterranean robotic exploration challenge held in 2021 by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\nWritten from scratch by the three UCLA researchers in the programming language C++, DLIOM contains less than 3,000 lines of code, as opposed to a typical algorithm developed by a large team that consists of 5,000-10,000 lines. The design allows for minimal programming redundancy and computational complexity, while preserving flexibility for real-world robotics applications.\nThe authors are exploring the possibility of patenting the algorithm through the UCLA Technology Development Group for a software license."},{"title":"UCLA Aerospace Engineering Senior Builds, Launches Rockets and More","summary":"Anjali Koganti knew she wanted to be an engineer ever since she built her first computer from scratch at age 8 alongside her father","img":"https://samueli.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/samueli/Anjali-Koganti-800x450-1.jpg","date":"Jul 17, 2023","full_text":"Anjali Koganti knew she wanted to be an engineer ever since she built her first computer from scratch at age 8 alongside her father. Now the rising fourth-year student at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering reached yet another milestone on her journey to become an aerospace engineer as a 2023 Brooke Owens Fellow and a summer intern at The Aerospace Corporation.\nGrowing up in San Diego, Koganti said as a child, her dream job was to be an artist, but she also enjoyed building things — circuits, potato batteries, or elaborate Lego sets. \n“I remember being enthralled with the way all the pieces fit together and how putting my hands on each piece helped teach me what each component did,” Koganti said.\nDrawn to creative projects that allow her to work with her hands to make something, Koganti attended engineering camps for young girls at nearby UC San Diego where she started to develop confidence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n“Engineering is a multifaceted subject — it’s a practical, distinctly creative and flexible discipline that aims to answer the question, ‘how can a problem be solved in the best way possible?’” Koganti said. \nAnjali Koganti pictured with Team Prometheus’s hybrid rocket Persephone right before its October 2022 launch in the Mojave Desert. Photo courtesy of Anjali Koganti\nWhen it came time to apply for college, Koganti knew that staying in Southern California would allow her to not only avoid cold weather but also take advantage of career opportunities at numerous aerospace companies in the area. She was impressed by the resources, faculty and reputation of UCLA Samueli where she visited as a junior in high school. But more importantly, she remembered touring the lab of Rocket Project at UCLA. The student-led club left an indelible impression on the teenager.\nSoon after she was admitted to UCLA, Koganti joined the organization and has since learned to design, build and troubleshot a hybrid rocket, which is powered by a combination of solid fuel and a liquid oxidizer.  She has also stepped up and taken on leadership roles, including serving as the club’s project lead and outreach director. \nLast October, she and her Prometheus team successfully launched its hybrid rocket Persephone, reaching 3,000 feet in the Mojave Desert before it had an engine burn through — no small feat considering the team was completely made up of new members except for her and a co-lead.\n“It was one of the best moments of my life seeing that rocket go up after a grueling year of long nights in the lab,” Koganti said. “It was very stressful, but watching the rocket blast off definitely made it all worthwhile.”\nHaving honed her skills building rockets from concept to launch as a seasoned Rocket Project member, Koganti took on another role last year as an instructor for the undergraduate Engineering 96 course: Rocketry Introduction for Student Education. She took the course in 2020 as a freshman herself, and despite it being taught online due to the COVID pandemic, she said she learned many of the fundamental principles that continue to guide her work today.\n“My favorite moment was watching my students launch their rockets knowing that they were able to do so using the skills and knowledge that I taught them,” Koganti said.\nOutside of the classroom and the rocket lab, Koganti also serves as an Engineering Ambassador, giving tours of the school to prospective students and their parents. “Being an Engineering Ambassador has enabled me to inspire the next class of UCLA Samueli engineers, paying forward the kindness of my own engineering mentors,” Koganti said. \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tKoganti’s time at UCLA Samueli has solidified her love for engineering and allowed her to foster new passions, such as coding. During the summer before her junior year, Koganti put that newfound knowledge to use in her first industry internship working with simulations and control at Relativity Space — an aerospace manufacturing company based in Long Beach, California. \n\n“Engineering is a multifaceted subject — it’s a practical, distinctly creative and flexible discipline that aims to answer the question, ‘how can a problem be solved in the best way possible?’” Anjali Koganti said.\n\nThe positive experience deepened Koganti’s resolve to pursue a career in the aerospace industry. She applied last October for the Brooke Owens Fellowship and was selected as one of 47 fellows for 2023. The program was established in memory of Brooke Owens — a pilot and space policy expert who worked with NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration and the White House. The fellowship is designed to provide internship opportunities for undergraduate women and other gender minorities interested in the aerospace industry.\nEach awardee is paired with a company for a summer internship and offered opportunities to learn from multiple industry mentors. The fellows are also invited to the Brooke Owens Fellowship Future Space Leaders Conference in Washington D.C., where they get to meet other mentors and fellows.\nAs an intern at The Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, California, Koganti is developing a modeling and simulation software and hardware system for satellites. She said she is most excited to gain new experiences and skills through the internship, especially since this will be her first time developing hardware in industry.\n“One of the most positive things that I can take away from the fellowship is the community of exceptional women,” Koganti said. “All of the fellows, both past and present, serve as inspiration and support in such a male-dominated field, and I look forward to leaning on them during my future career.”\nIn addition to receiving the Brooke Owens Fellowship, Koganti was recently awarded a William S. Klug Memorial Scholarship from UCLA Samueli in recognition of her many contributions to the school. \nRiley de Jong contributed to this story."},{"title":"Physical Oceanographer Joins UCLA Civil and Environmental Engineering Department","summary":"Isabella Arzeno Soltero has joined the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering July 1 as an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering","img":"https://samueli.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/samueli/Isabella-Arzeno-Soltero-800x450-1.jpg","date":"Jul 13, 2023","full_text":"Isabella Arzeno Soltero has joined the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering July 1 as an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering.
