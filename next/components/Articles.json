He soon found his passion for cryptography — the science of concealing and securing information using techniques derived from mathematical concepts — and worked as a fellow at Microsoft Research in India, where he learned more about the subject and decided to pursue a Ph.D.\nWeighing several school offers, Jain chose UCLA Samueli after visiting the campus at Sahai’s invitation.\nOver the past 20 years, Sahai has established himself as one of the world’s top cryptography researchers. He directs the National Science Foundation-supported Center for Encrypted Functionalities at UCLA, and is a fellow at ACM and the International Association for Cryptologic Research.\nBut it was more than Sahai’s list of major accomplishments that made an impression on Jain.\n“When I visited Amit for the first time, we discussed a technical problem and I could feel a special connection,” Jain recalled. “Amit excels at identifying the needs of the students. I would thank him the most for helping me to develop big-picture tastes in research and for instilling in me the confidence to be more fearless in research.”\n\n“It’s a tightly knit department and everyone takes personal interest in the development of students,” Aayush Jain said of his experience studying for his doctoral degree in the Computer Science Department at UCLA.\n\nIn 2020, working alongside Sahai and Huijia “Rachel” Lin of the University of Washington, Jain proved that iO does, in fact, exist. The team unveiled its landmark findings in a preprint archive, a common practice in which researchers present a preliminary version of a paper before it goes through a peer review process. The breakthrough instantly drew rave reviews, including a feature in Quanta Magazine and in Forbes. A peer-reviewed paper was published and presented the following year at the 2021 ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing.\nACM selected Jain’s Ph.D. dissertation, “Indistinguishability obfuscation from well-founded assumptions,” for its 2022 Doctoral Dissertation Award honoring the best doctoral thesis in computer science and engineering, which also includes a $20,000 prize.\nCryptography scientist Craig Gentry, whose dissertation detailed the first fully homomorphic encryption he constructed that allows a computer to function with encrypted data, won the same award in 2009 and served as an inspiration for Jain’s research.\nLooking back, Jain said his time at UCLA provided an important springboard for his teaching and research career.\n“It’s a tightly knit department and everyone takes personal interest in the development of students,” Jain said. “I feel close to so many other professors and could routinely talk about different research/non-research things, which was memorable.”\nNow, as an assistant professor at Carnegie Melon, Jain is leading his own research group aiming to develop efficient obfuscation schemes by utilizing underleveraged assumptions and exploring new sources for hard problems previously well-studied in other domains.\n“I believe that cryptography and complexity are a match made in heaven,” Jain said. “This area could be a source of well-understood problems requiring us to realize new feasibility goals in cryptography that have eluded us.”"},{"title":"From Aviation to Programming, a Rising Senior’s UCLA Journey Helps Him Discover His Passion","summary":"Jake Sager loves to fly","img":"https://samueli.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/samueli/Jake-Sager.png","date":"Aug 14, 2023","full_text":"Jake Sager loves to fly.\nHe was a precocious pilot. At 10 years old, he was soaring across the world, calling air traffic control on his radio as the landscape rolled by below, impossibly fast. But through all this, Sager hadn’t left his living room. He had taken flight courtesy of a desktop simulator his parents had purchased for his home computer.\nSager, who is now on the cusp of his senior year in computer science at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, has spent his time on campus treading a path between his love of aviation and his fascination with science and math.\nGrowing up, Sager had always liked to tinker with computers. Toying with a website-building software in elementary school, he found himself wanting to know what made the tool work, a question that led him into the world of computer science.\n“It seemed like a chicken-egg type of problem,” Sager said. “So, I did a bit of digging online … and learned that most websites aren’t developed using online tools, but rather are programmed.”\nInspired by this discovery, Sager taught himself to code in HTML, JavaScript and CSS — the programming languages that make up the backbone of the internet. As he grew, he continued to build on this knowledge, learning how to build iPhone applications and websites with animations by the time he entered high school.\nIt was the virtual world that brought Sager his love of aviation, too. Around the same time he was learning to build websites, he was also flying via his computer. His parents decided to enroll him in an aviation summer camp near their Encinitas, California home.\nSager would continue his training, flying solo for the first time at the age of 16, just as he was preparing to apply to college. He knew he wanted to pursue a field that blended his love of science and technology with his passion for aviation.\nUCLA struck him as stunningly beautiful, verdant and serene despite its proximity to the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles. This, coupled with UCLA Samueli’s reputation for academic rigor, cemented his decision to come to UCLA.\n\n“It always fills me with joy to see people’s faces light up when I explain things in a way that helped them make sense of what is going on,” Jake Sager said of his experience mentoring students at UCLA.\n\nSager started his freshman year majoring in aerospace engineering. He was immediately drawn to student clubs Rocket Project and Design Build Fly. But this was fall of 2020, when COVID-19 rampaged across the globe and shut down in-person instruction.\nIt was then that the tides started to turn for Sager. He still loved aviation, but not so much the engineering part of making a plane. He decided to enroll in Computer Science 31 — a course covering the foundational concepts, principles and methodologies of computer science.\n“I immediately fell in love with computer science,” Sager said. “Programming felt right at home.”\nLearning in a virtual environment, Sager found an innovative way to forge connections with other students on campus: class GroupMe chats. In the absence of in-person interaction, Sager found himself a virtual community, answering fellow students’ online class questions — even the ones to which he didn’t immediately know the answers and had to spend time researching.\nWhen UCLA returned to in-person instruction in fall 2021, Sager received an invitation to the university’s chapter of Tau Beta Pi, a national honor society of engineers. As a member of the organization, Sager was required to tutor at least once a week during its drop-in hours in Boelter Hall.\nEven though he had gained some experience in online tutoring through GroupMe, Sager was initially unsure about tutoring in person. But he overcame his fear and took to the work quickly, so much so that he was soon elected as the group’s tutoring chair.\n“It always fills me with joy to see people’s faces light up when I explain things in a way that helped them make sense of what is going on,” said Sager, who is one of Tau Beta Pi’s incoming vice presidents. “I also think it’s really rewarding in that I have an opportunity to stay fresh on the content in lower division classes that I wouldn’t revisit regularly otherwise.”\nJuggling his studies and his responsibilities at Tau Beta Pi, Sager also became a member of the UCLA chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, a computer science honor society. Later that summer, as he prepared for his junior year, he secured a software engineering internship with Viasat, a communications company specializing in satellite internet.\nBut it was an internship this summer with Boeing’s commercial airplanes department that would give Sager the chance to combine his passion for computer science with his long-held love of aviation.\n“Although I wasn’t enjoying aerospace engineering itself, I have the feeling I will enjoy doing computer science work while being in an immersive aviation environment,” Sager said. “I had always hoped to experiment with combining my academic interests with my hobbies, and this seems like the perfect opportunity.”\nOn path to graduate from UCLA next June, Sager says he hopes to work as a software engineer but he is also contemplating about pursuing a master’s degree. No matter what he decides to do next, Sager is sure to continue soaring — both in the sky and in his career."},{"title":"New Study Identifies Genes Linked to High Production of Key Antibody\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDiscovery made possible by UCLA-developed nanotechnology","summary":"A collaboration led by UCLA and the Seattle Children’s Research Institute has yielded new knowledge about the genes responsible for the production and release of immunoglobulin G, the most common type of antibody in the human body","img":"https://samueli.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/samueli/New-study-identifies-genes-linked-to-high-production-of-key-antibody.png","date":"Aug 14, 2023","full_text":"A collaboration led by UCLA and the Seattle Children’s Research Institute has yielded new knowledge about the genes responsible for the production and release of immunoglobulin G, the most common type of antibody in the human body.\nThe finding has the potential to advance manufacturing of antibody-based therapies for diseases such as cancer and arthritis, as well as the development of medical treatments that rely on the production of antibodies.\nAntibodies are a group of proteins that are crucial to the immune system. Immunoglobulin G, or IgG, stores memories of past infections and tags dangerous microbes to be eliminated by immune cells. Mothers’ IgG is also vital for their newborns’ immune defense.\nScientists have known for decades that a population of white blood cells, called plasma B cells, make IgG. Plasma B cells are highly efficient, producing more than 10,000 IgG molecules every second. But the molecular mechanisms that enable plasma cells to secrete antibodies into the bloodstream are still not fully understood.\nIn order to learn more about those mechanisms, the researchers performed an analysis that had never been done before: They captured thousands of single plasma B cells as well as their individual secretions, and then connected the amount of proteins each individual cell released to an atlas mapping tens of thousands of genes expressed by that same cell.\nTo collect the cells and their secretions, the researchers used microscopic, bowl-shaped hydrogel containers called nanovials, which were developed in prior UCLA research.\nTheir analysis found that genes involved with producing energy and eliminating abnormal proteins were even more important for high IgG secretion than the genes containing instructions for making the antibody itself. They also discovered that the presence of CD59, a gene that had not previously been linked to IgG secretion, is a better predictor of high-producing plasma cells than other genetic markers already associated with this cell type.\n“These processes in cells are like an assembly line for making proteins, and there are lots of places where you could see bottlenecks,” said Dino Di Carlo, the Armond and Elena Hairapetian Professor of Engineering and Medicine at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering and a co-corresponding author of the study. “Things have to be moving smoothly in sync across the cell. If a cell is making a lot of proteins, it’s using a lot of energy and needs a way to correct the proteins that get messed up.”\nThe study was published in the journal Nature Communications. Di Carlo, who is also a member of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA and the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, said the findings could not only advance fundamental understandings of biology but also could have applications in biomedicine.\nFor instance, knowing which genes are associated with higher secretion of an antibody could be used by pharmaceutical makers to engineer cells that secrete large volumes of the antibody. That knowledge could also be applied to an emerging strategy that introduces engineered cells directly to patients’ bodies, such as the potential cell therapies under development by University of Washington immunologist Richard James, a co-corresponding author of the paper.\nThe new way in which nanovials and a standard laboratory setup were used in the study also opens up new possibilities for understanding how the instructions contained in DNA are translated into the behaviors of cells.\nEach nanovial contains molecules tailored to bind with proteins on the surface of the cells that the researchers are investigating, which enables the nanovial to capture a single cell at a time. Once that cell is immobilized and protected within the nanovial “bowl,” its secretions also accumulate and are attached to specific antibodies engineered to capture them.\nIn the study, the investigators trapped tens of thousands of plasma cells, along with the IgG they released, in nanovials with a diameter about one-third the thickness of a sheet of paper. The nanovials were then run through an instrument to analyze each cell’s messenger RNA, or mRNA.\nEvery cell in an individual’s body carries the same blueprint written in DNA. So scientists detect which genes are active by looking at the mRNA, which translates those instructions so that each cell can build proteins that are specific to its functions.\n“There are multiple layers of information in each cell,” Di Carlo said. “We’re able to link the final layer — the amount of proteins actually secreted that have a clear function throughout the body — back to the more fundamental layer of genetic code. There’s currently no other technique that is available to do that. Now that we have this approach, the most interesting thing, to me, is which question to ask next.”\nIn future studies, the researchers hope to identify all of the genes that affect plasma cells’ production and secretion of IgG.\nNanovials are available commercially from Partillion Bioscience, a company co-founded by Di Carlo that is based in CNSI’s on-campus startup incubator, Magnify.\nThe first authors of the study are Rene Cheng of the University of Washington and Joseph de Rutte, who earned a doctorate from UCLA in 2020 and is a co-founder and CEO of Partillion. Other authors are affiliated with UW, Partillion and the Seattle-based company Luminex. The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Seattle Children’s Research Institute."},{"title":"Two Assistant Professors Join UCLA Civil and Environmental Engineering Department","summary":"The UCLA Samueli School of Engineering has appointed two new faculty members with sustainability-focused research backgrounds to its Civil and Environmental Engineering Department","img":"https://samueli.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/samueli/CEE-new-faculty2.png","date":"Aug 11, 2023","full_text":"The UCLA Samueli School of Engineering has appointed two new faculty members with sustainability-focused research backgrounds to its Civil and Environmental Engineering Department.
