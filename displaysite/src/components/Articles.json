The UCLA project’s principal investigator is materials science and engineering professor Bruce Dunn, who holds UCLA’s Nippon Sheet Glass Company Chair. He is also UCLA Samueli’s associate dean for research and physical resources. Materials science and engineering professor Morris Wang, who joined UCLA from LLNL in 2020, is the co-principal investigator.\nThe team’s eventual goal is to improve lithium-ion batteries by increasing the available power, speeding up charging time, and making them cheaper to manufacture while wasting less material in the process. 3D printing allows for the creation of a more intricate interior battery structure that can store more power — a development critical to the new manufacturing process.\nLithium-ion batteries, with their excellent energy-to-weight ratios, are already ubiquitous in phones, laptops, electric vehicles and a range of other consumer products. However, there are limits to the power they can provide and how fast they can be charged. More powerful lithium ion batteries could lead to the development and adoption of more clean electric vehicles, as well as new energy storage technologies for the electric grid.\nThe new project builds on a previous collaboration between UCLA and LLNL that led to the development of several cathode ink compositions and demonstrated excellent performance in 3D-printed cathodes, which are the part of the battery that contains lithium ion. The UCLA group has been developing and characterizing 3D battery materials that offer high energy and power density, while researchers from LLNL have made several advances in 3D-printed materials that offer more design freedom without employing expensive and wasteful fabrication processes."

        "full_text":"UCLA materials scientists and colleagues at the nonprofit scientific research institute SRI International have developed a new material and manufacturing process for creating artificial muscles that are stronger and more flexible than their biological counterparts.\n“Creating an artificial muscle to enable work and detect force and touch has been one of the grand challenges of science and engineering,” said Qibing Pei, a professor of materials science and engineering at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering and the corresponding author of a study recently published in Science. \nA jumping robot, about 1.2 centimeters in diameter, fitted with PHDE actuators\nIn order for a soft material to be considered for use as an artificial muscle, it must be able to output mechanical energy and remain viable under high-strain conditions — meaning it does not easily lose its form and strength after repeated work cycles. While many materials have been considered contenders for making artificial muscles, dielectric elastomers (DE) — lightweight materials with high elastic energy density — have been of special interest because of their optimal flexibility and toughness. \nDielectric elastomers are electroactive polymers, which are natural or synthetic substances composed of large molecules that can change in size or shape when stimulated by an electric field. They can be used as actuators, enabling machines to operate by transforming electric energy into mechanical work.\nMost dielectric elastomers are made of either acrylic or silicone, but both materials have drawbacks. While traditional acrylic DEs can achieve high actuation strain, they require pre-stretching and lack flexibility. Silicones are easier to make, but they cannot withstand high strain. \nUtilizing commercially available chemicals and employing an ultraviolet (UV) light curing process, the UCLA-led research team created an improved acrylic-based material that is more pliable, tunable and simpler to scale without losing its strength and endurance. While the acrylic acid enables more hydrogen bonds to form, thereby making the material more movable, the researchers also adjusted the crosslinking between polymer chains, enabling the elastomers to be softer and more flexible. The resulting thin, processable, high-performance dielectric elastomer film, or PHDE, is then sandwiched between two electrodes to convert electrical energy into motion as an actuator. \nEach PHDE film is as thin and light as a piece of human hair, about 35 micrometers in thickness, and when multiple layers are stacked together, they become a miniature electric motor that can act like muscle tissue and produce enough energy to power motion for small robots or sensors. The researchers have made stacks of PHDE films varying from four to 50 layers.\n\n“This flexible, versatile and efficient actuator could open the gates for artificial muscles in new generations of robots, or in sensors and wearable tech that can more accurately mimic or even improve humanlike motion and capabilities,” Qibing Pei said.\n\nArtificial muscles fitted with PHDE actuators can generate more megapascals of force than biological muscles and they also demonstrate three to 10 times more flexibility than natural muscles.\nMultilayered soft films are usually manufactured via a “wet” process that involves depositing and curing liquid resin. But that process can result in uneven layers, which make for a poor- performing actuator. For this reason, up to now, many actuators have only been successful with single-layer DE films. \nThe UCLA research involves a “dry” process by which the films are layered using a blade and then UV-cured to harden, making the layers uniform. This increases the actuator’s energy output so that the device can support more complex movements.\nThe simplified process, along with the flexible and durable nature of the PHDE, allows for the manufacture of new soft actuators capable of bending to jump, like spider legs, or winding up and spinning. The researchers also demonstrated the PHDE actuator’s ability to toss a pea-sized ball 20 times heavier than the PHDE films. The actuator can also expand and contract like a diaphragm when a voltage is switched on and off, giving a glimpse of how artificial muscles could be used in the future. \n\nhttps://samueli.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/samueli/Compiled-PHDE-SI-Videos.mp4\nCourtesy of Qibing PeiUCLA researchers demonstrate the capabilities of the PHDE actuators they developed that can expand, contract and toss a pea-sized ball.\n\nThe advance could lead to soft robots with improved mobility and endurance, and new wearable and haptic technologies with a sense of touch. The manufacturing process could also be applied to other soft thin-film materials for applications including microfluidic technologies, tissue engineering or microfabrication.\nOther authors of the study from the UCLA Materials Science and Engineering Department are Ye Shi, Erin Askounis, Roshan Plamthottam, Zihang Peng, Kareem Youssef and Junhong Pu —all current or former members of Pei’s Soft Materials Research Lab at UCLA. Shi, Askounis and Plamthottam are co-lead authors of the study. The authors from SRI International are Tom Libby and Ron Pelrine.\nThe research was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).\nThe team, through the UCLA Technology Development Group, has filed for an international patent on the technology.  \nNatalie Weber contributed to this story."

        "full_text":"UCLA computer scientists and genetics specialists in collaboration with their colleagues from several other institutions have developed a new genomic data computational method. Their improved algorithms can analyze genomic data up to 1,800 times faster than previous techniques, making it possible to analyze the genetic information of 1 million individuals in just one day.\nLed by UCLA associate professor Sriram Sankararaman, the research team has developed a computation method called SCalable pOPulation structure inferencE, or SCOPE, which is designed to speed up and scale inference of population structure. Population structure inference examines the genetic variations of a population to find patterns that guide conclusions or deter false associations in research.\nThe researchers made two major algorithmic improvements that enabled the team to analyze large genomic datasets accurately and expeditiously. Details on the new methods have recently been published in the American Journal of Human Genetics.\nSankararaman has joint appointments in UCLA’s departments of computer science and human genetics, as well as computational medicine — a department affiliated with both the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering and the David Geffen School of Medicine. \nSince the early 2000s, there have been various methods used to study population structure, or comparisons of genomes in various populations, which can reveal how individuals relate to one another and to their ancestors. The findings are also key to identifying genetic risk factors for diseases that may affect a particular population more than others.\nHowever, as the amount of genomic data has continued to grow rapidly over the years, improved computational methods that can keep pace with the massive growth of datasets are needed to provide fast and accurate genomic data analyses.  \n\n“We wanted to develop a method that would enable population structure inference, a commonly performed analysis, for the largest datasets available today and [the ones that are] yet to come,” said Alec Chiu.\n“We wanted to develop a method that would enable population structure inference, a commonly performed analysis, for the largest datasets available today and [the ones that are] yet to come,” said Alec Chiu, the study’s lead author and a UCLA interdepartmental bioinformatics doctoral student studying under Sankararaman. “One of the important challenges in developing scalable methods is to provide improvements in terms of both time and computational resources.” \nSCOPE improves upon previous population structure inference methods by reducing the amount of computational resources necessary to process large datasets, which also drives down the cost of running calculations. In one of its experiments, the research team used just 250 gigabytes of memory for computation instead of the roughly 2,000 gigabytes — the equivalent of 125 laptops with 16-GB memory each — needed with a previous research tool.\nThe research team has made SCOPE available to the public on its lab’s GitHub website, with the hope that it may benefit other researchers studying population genetics.\nFor their experiments, the researchers used UK Biobank’s repository of genomic data from 488,363 individuals, with many times more genetic variants.\n“Several massive datasets are still yet to come, such as the All of Us Research Project and the Million Veteran Program, each of which aim to obtain genetic data from 1 million people,” Chiu said, referencing the datasets being compiled by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs, respectively. “We created SCOPE to enable analyses of such datasets.”\nThe interdisciplinary research team included individuals with experience in computer science, human genetics, machine learning and computational medicine from UCLA, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Maryland and Meta Platforms, Inc. \nSankararaman’s lab also utilizes computational genetics to make discoveries about ancient human relatives, such as Denisovans, who were contemporaries of Neanderthals, and an unnamed extinct human relative that lived in West Africa. \nThe SCOPE research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship. \nNatalie Weber contributed to this story."
